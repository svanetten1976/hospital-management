## Quick start

1.  Make sure that you have Node.js v8.15.1 up to v14.19.0 and npm v5 or above installed. You will also need Yarn in order to run this project locally.
2.  Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/svanetten1976/hospital-management <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
3.  Move to the appropriate directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.<br />
4.  Ensure that you are running Node 14.19.0 or less if you are in a Windows environment, and make sure that you have Yarn installed and ready to use.<br />
5.  Run the 'yarn' or 'yarn install' command (either will work). This will install the node module dependencies you will need in order to run this project.
    <br />
    \_At this point you can run `yarn start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.\*
